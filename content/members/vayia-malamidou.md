When she graduated in 2000, she made a career change from archaeology to web development and worked in the digital content profession since then. She has a passion for making websites a great experience for all users. She likes discovering and supporting the things that make people happy at work and in life in general. She lives in the southwest of England with her family and their cat. She loves baking bread and is immensely proud that she has managed to keep a sourdough starter alive for nine years."
