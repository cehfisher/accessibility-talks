bio: "AmyJune currently works with the Linux Foundation as their Certificate Community Architect. She is responsible for supporting the Certification team's efforts in building and maintaining exams and related documentation for exam products in the Linux Foundation's certification portfolio.

She is a Drupal core mentor. She has the unique privilege of being a non-code developer and has the ability to bridge the gap between the technical writers, the coders, the developers, and the designers and connect them with first-time contributors with skill sets that match their specific contribution needs. AmyJune helps communities discover how they can contribute and belong in more ways than code.

Her ongoing experience as a hospice nurse keeps her in touch with the challenges faced by many end-users. Outside of her mission in the technology community space, she has a deep love for mycology, geocaching, and air-cooled Volkswagens."
