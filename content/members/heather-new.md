bio: "Heather combines her love of tech with her eye for design to create products that function as beautifully as they look. Her IT background informs technical decisions and helps simplify complex ideas. Her empathy kicks in when she watches people struggle with tech and has led her to deep dive into user experience, user interface and accessibility.

Design thinking has become a lifestyle for Heather as she takes the creative process she has developed and applies the same concepts to her off-screen life as well. In fact, you can often find Heather testing out new tools, crafting with wood, working on home improvement projects or at her local maker space. "
