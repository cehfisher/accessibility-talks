With your help, we can create the most accessible and fun space possible to learn, share, and grow digital accessibility knowledge in our community, through our mission and values.

Since its inception, A11yTalks has hosted a variety of live talks and panels covering topics related to digital accessibility for beginners, developers, and creatives. All of these videos are streamed and then archived on the [A11yTalks YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/accessibilitytalks) with cleaned up captions.

Our content is available to the public as a free resource for digital accessibility education as well as continuing education credits for certified International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP).
In 2022, we assembled an [all-volunteer team](https://a11ytalks.com/pages/about), passionately contributing time and energy to sustain the project, and we became fiscally hosted by a non-profit, Open Collective Foundation (501)(c)(3).

Now, we need your support to help us meet our accessibility goals, compensate our amazing speakers, and improve our live stream productions to provide the best value possible for our community.

## Budget Priorities for 2023

1. __Live captions__ ($150/month, $1,800/annualy): Staying true to our value of accessibility, high quality live captions are our top priority to ensure our live stream is accessible to as many people as possible. Our current vendor provides live human-generated captions.
1. __Speaker stipend__ ($100/month, $1,200/annually): We believe in compensating our speakers for the time they spend creating amazing content and sharing it with our viewers.
1. __Streaming service__ ($20/month, $240/annually):
Streamyard is our tool of choice. A paid subscription gives us more flexibility and control in how our talks are presented, giving us all of the [features of the basic plan](https://streamyard.com/pricing).
1. __Live American Sign Language interpreter__ ($300/month, $3,600/annually):
Including live ASL interpretation would allow us to reach even more people than captions and further increase the accessibility of our content. See [Shattering Assumptions About Deafness](https://youtu.be/hTZqC6uVmuQ) - Meryl Evans for an example of our content delivered in ASL for viewers.
1. __Operations__ ($54/month, $645/annually): Operations include necessary technical items such as domain renewal, web hosting, etc. We have also included general liability insurance, which would protect the A11yTalks project from claims like libel or slander. *These costs are billed annually.*
