description: "Matthew knew from a young age that he was different. Though he didn't know why. It wasn't until he was an adult and really dug into his own daughter's special needs, that he was able to begin a journey of self discovery. We'll talk about his lived experience with Autism, Attention Deficit Disorder, and Dyslexia."
