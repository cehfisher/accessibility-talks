description: "As of August 2020, there are over 4.7 million disabled veterans in the United States. They are all dealing with a variety of disabilities connected to their time in the service. To say this is an under-represented group is an understatement. With the right help, these veterans can transition into the tech industry which is chronically short of developers of all stripes."

As of August 2020, there are over 4.7 million disabled veterans in the United States. They are all dealing with a variety of disabilities connected to their time in the service. To say this is an under-represented group is an understatement. With the right help, these veterans can transition into the tech industry which is chronically short of developers of all stripes.

I received help and followed a path to becoming a Drupal developer. I will outline my path to becoming a Drupal developer through the VAs Vocational Rehabilitation Program and use it as an example of what disabled veterans can do to get started in Drupal. I will also speak to what employers can do to assist veterans who want to become Drupal developers.
