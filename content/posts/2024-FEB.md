description: "This session will investigate the hidden questions in the websites and applications we build: Who is this for? Who is able to use it? Who is unable to use it? Why is this the case? What previous experiences, assumptions, and understandings do we incorporate into the things we create? By exploring the process by which my organization rebuilt its website, I’ll provide examples and methods for going beyond simply meeting WCAG guidelines—instead, reaching for a new way of thinking about technology, our place in its development, and our work overall. We’ll also present concrete ways that everyone involved in the creation of a website or application—from project managers to designers to developers to content creators—can bring accessibility practices into their day-to-day efforts."
