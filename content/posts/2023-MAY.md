description: "One would think that language has been solved in 2023. We have translation apps, sign languages, an international phonetic alphabet that is supposed to be able to represent any sound in any language for academics to endlessly discuss over. And yet, the challenges are myriad. From screen readers not knowing how to pronounce the ultimate guide to pronouncing things to less than helpful apps and from several different alphabets to unhelpful, incorrect language tagging, the topic of linguistics accessibility can be a wonderfully twisty-turny rabbit hole to go down.
For the last few years I've been looking into this, and I have learned loads of different things. This talk aims to take the audience through some of those learnings."
