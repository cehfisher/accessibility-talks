description: "When it comes to web accessibility, timing is of the essence. It's easier when you do it earlier. What if your CMS could spot content problems and help you fix them, before your content even goes live? What if it could warn content editors about potential issues, ship with accessible defaults, make it easier to see content structure implications and offer alternatives to inaccessible content (like colours with better contrast). In Hidde's talk, you'll learn how these kinds of features can help you 'shift left'."

When it comes to web accessibility, timing is of the essence. It’s easier when you do it earlier. What if your CMS could spot content problems and help you fix them, before your content even goes live? What if it could warn content editors about potential issues, ship with accessible defaults, make it easier to see content structure implications and offer alternatives to inaccessible content (like colours with better contrast). In Hidde’s talk, you’ll learn how these kinds of features can help you “shift left”.
