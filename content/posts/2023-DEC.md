description: "A lot of eslint rules and reusable components already exist for accessibility in HTML, Javascript and React. When working with developers with varying levels of theoretical and practical experience with accessibility implementations, we realised that the mistakes that our devs were making with respect to accessible implementations, were either not general enough to have an existing eslint rule and / or the mitigation was very specific to the usages in our codebase. We started with a simple thought: can we automate the detection and fixes for these repeated mistakes? This led to creation of codebase / team specific a11y aslant rules and Semantic components. This talk will give an overview of how to build this thought process with examples, and how it can possibly help your team."
