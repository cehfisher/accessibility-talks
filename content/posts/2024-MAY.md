description: "Open Source means nothing to the larger accessibility community. That is a problem. Proprietary solutions limit access to vital accessibility tools. This presentation outlines existing Open Source accessibility solutions while asking the question 'Why aren’t there more Open Source a11y tools?' The presentation is meant to be both a survey of existing solutions and a call to action for new Open Source solutions. Web Accessibility stagnates without more Open Source A11y tools."
