description: "Overlays are technologies implemented on websites with the aim of increasing accessibility. Even if these Overlays could do as they claim, they would still have a fundamental flaw. You can never out code bad design. During this talk let's discuss how Overlays will never be the answer and the importance of accessible, inclusive, and usable designs."

What are some of the most common issues found in PDFs when it comes to accessibility â€“ and how do you fix them?

Helen will lead us through a live demo showing the differences between PAC3 and the Adobe accessibility checker, plus give us helpful remediation advice for common issues you might encounter.
