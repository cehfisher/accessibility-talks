In this talk, we will discuss the next generation of automated testing. Our speaker, the Founder of SiteLint, recalibrated the remediation process significantly, improving accessibility quality testing and focusing on the user behavior. He will discuss the new technology and it's unique approach. It goes beyond crawling and analyzing data on the server side.

It's common for Accessibility to be a combination of manual and automated testing. The importance of automated testing grows with the size of web apps or sites. The manual testing process was also "rebuilt" as a part of this innovative technology!
